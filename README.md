Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install arm-cli
```

Once installed, setup the CLI initially by running `arm-cli system setup`. You may need to rerun if you update the CLI via pip. This will do things like configure system settings to enable tab complete.

For help, run:
```bash
arm-cli --help
```
You can also use:


```bash
python -m arm_cli --help
```
## Development

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:
```bash
cd arm-cli
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e '.[test]'
```
To run the tests:
```bash
python -m pytest
