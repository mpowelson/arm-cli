Probably mostly in order
1) Global config - store active session info
2) Project config - store path for `cdc`, data dirs, etc
3) Add additional tab completes
4) Additional integration tests on project setup
5) Deployment tools - possibly using ansible or maybe save that for later
6) Connect to container registries for skill install
7) More comprehensive documentation of intent

These are probably not all-encompassing, but it's what I am thinking about right now.

Other ideas
* Ansible
* LLM project configuration assistant - connection to skill docs
* ARM checks in CI - probably no reason to, but it does need to work there
